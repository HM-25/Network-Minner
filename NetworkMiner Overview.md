NetworkMiner Overview

NetworkMiner is a versatile tool used in network forensics and incident response. It operates as a passive network sniffer and packet capturing tool, enabling the detection of operating systems, sessions, hostnames, and open ports without actively putting traffic on the network. Additionally, it can parse PCAP files for offline analysis, allowing users to regenerate and reassemble transmitted files and certificates.
Key Features:

    Passive Network Sniffing: Detects various network characteristics without generating traffic.
    PCAP File Parsing: Enables offline analysis of captured traffic data.
    Artifact Extraction: Simplifies network traffic analysis by presenting extracted artifacts in an intuitive interface.
